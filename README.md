# Challengethree-passwordgen

## Description

This is challenge three for the UT Austin Bootcamp. The goal of this project is to tie in all three languages that we have learned so far such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a password generator. Upon hitting the generate button you will be asked to select the number of character that you would like your password to consist of ranging from at least 8 to 128 characters. The following prompts will ask you for preference surrounding your password such as capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Once, all of the users information is collected a random generated password will be created.


## Goal

The goal of this project was to learn how to tie in all three languages effectively and showcase my ability in making a static website truly interactive. 

## Usage

This project can be used to generate passwords for any login you encounter. Whether you are creating a new profile and signing up for a website or trying to enhance the security around any account that you might have. Of course, it is recommended that you save this password in your google passwords or write it down in a special place, this will surely secure your future accounts and make them incredible hard for a hacker to secure with no one password being the same.
